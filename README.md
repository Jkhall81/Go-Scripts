# Go-Scripts

I am learning Go.  So I am going to rewrite all the Perl scripts / tools that I use on a daily basis at work, and store them here.  I started with this Parser program.  The Perl version of this is super slow.  In it's defense though I am 95% sure that it is so slow because of the 'xlsx' dependency it is using.  

Also any new backend automation tasks I do at work I am going to do in Go, and then store those here as well.
